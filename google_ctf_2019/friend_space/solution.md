Having snooped around like the expert spy you were never trained to be, you found something that takes your interest: "Cookie/www.FriendSpaceBookPlusAllAccessRedPremium.com" But unbeknownst to you, it was only the 700nm Wavelength herring rather than a delicious cookie that you could have found. It looks exactly like a credential for another system. You find yourself in search of a friendly book to read.

Having already spent some time trying to find a way to gain more intelligence... and learn about those fluffy creatures, you (several)-momentarily divert your attention here. It's a place of all the individuals in the world sharing large amounts of data with one another. Strangely enough, all of the inhabitants seem to speak using this weird pictorial language. And there is hot disagreement over what the meaning of an eggplant is.

But not much Cauliflower here. They must be very private creatures. SarahH has left open some proprietary tools, surely running this will take you to them. Decipher this language and move forth!

## Solution

We are given two files **program** and **vm.py**. Executing program gives a long list of 'command not found' errors at first.

Running `python vm.py` says it is missing program, so I tried again while passing program to it this time `python vm.py program`. It then starts to print out a url, though it does take some time. (if you don't have the patience `http://emoji-t0anaxnr3nacpt4na.web.ctfcompetition.com`). This brings up an interest website of cat pictures and their supposed feline friends.
